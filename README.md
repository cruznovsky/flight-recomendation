# flight-recomendation
It was my final project in Analyzing Big Data with SQL course:

Your job is to recommend which pair of United States airports should be connected with a high-speed passenger rail tunnel. The company you work for has given you the following strict requirements:

These two airports must:

- Be between 300 and 400 miles apart

- Average at least 5,000 (five thousand) flights per year between them, in each direction

Among the pairs of airports that meet these requirements, you must identify the one pair that has **the largest total number of seats** on the planes that flew between them.

The company is also interested to know **the average arrival delay** for flights between these two airports, because they believe that routes with a history of delayed arrivals will make it easier to persuade air travelers to switch to high-speed rail.

There are two tables that I used in my query: **flights and planes**
